Date: [Date]

AIM: To create a Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline in Jenkins and deploy it in the Cloud.

PROCEDURE:

STEP 1: Navigate to Repositories > pythondemoapp > General. Find the Docker command and copy it.

STEP 2: Go to your GitHub account, locate Containers, and copy the Docker command for future use.

STEP 3: Integrate the following code into the existing CI Pipeline script:

stage('Docker Deploy') {
    steps {
        script {
            withDockerRegistry(credentialsId: 'dbc54abf-de2b-42b8-a0d2-f5539c9b8997', toolName: 'docker') {
                sh "docker images"
                sh "docker run -d --rm -it -p 80:5000 jayashriashokkumar28112003/python-webapp:latest" // change with yours
            }
        }
    }
}
STEP 4: Click on Dashboard > python-webapp > Build Now

STEP 5: To access the Python web app, copy and paste the public IP of the AWS instance and include port 5000 at the end of it. (For example: 41.204.111.57:5000)

RESULT: The Continuous Deployment pipeline in Jenkins has been successfully configured, and the Python web app has been deployed in the Cloud.
